1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.023
30 seconds and counting.

2
00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:07.707
Astronauts report it feels
good, two minutes, 25 seconds.

3
00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.910
Before 1988,

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.280
astronomers knew of only eight planets

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.853
in the entire universe,
those around the sun.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.403
Today, we know of nearly 4,000.

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.170
These are called exoplanets,

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.520
and they orbit stars
outside of our solar system.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.800
The majority are so distant
when they're not moving,

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.810
that little can be learned
about these exoplanets.

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.070
We do not know if any support life,

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.830
but over the years, advances
in telescope technology

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.260
have made it easier to detect them.

14
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.140
Launched in 2009, a space
telescope called Kepler

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.880
has been responsible for finding

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.813
the majority of the
exoplanets we know today.

17
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.670
By staring at a single patch of the sky,

18
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.320
it found them as they passed
in front of their stars.

19
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.140
But Kepler could only focus

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.623
on planets around lots of distant stars.

21
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.530
Kepler is now retired.

22
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.773
It's been replaced with a new telescope.

23
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.280
Liftoff,

24
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.120
the SpaceX Falcon Nine carrying TESS,

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.190
a planet hunting
spacecraft that will search

26
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.737
for new worlds beyond our solar system.

27
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.443
TESS, which can scan the entire sky,

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740
and is equipped with four special cameras.

29
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610
It will look at around
200,000 preselected stars

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.423
that are closer and among the
brightest as seen from Earth.

31
00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:52.460
Over its two year mission,
TESS is expected to discover

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.603
hundreds of thousands of new planets.

33
00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:00.630
Like Kepler, it will be able to detect

34
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.660
the proximity of planets to their stars,

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.150
providing astronomers with some

36
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.490
information about their possible climates.

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.330
Because TESS will find planets

38
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.890
that are comparatively near to Earth,

39
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.400
other, bigger telescopes will be able

40
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.440
to take a more detailed look,

41
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.163
including looking for the
presence of liquid water.

42
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.960
If there is alien life out there,

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.433
TESS could play an important
role in finding it.

44
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.223
Coming up next Thursday,

45
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.387
could space be the next frontier for war?
